## API Endpoints

### Endpoint Category 1
```
METHOD /v1/endpoint/path
```
Brief description of what this endpoint does.

### Endpoint Category 2
```
METHOD /v1/endpoint/path
```
Brief description of what this endpoint does.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

Start the server:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access:
- Interactive API documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Alternative API documentation: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## API Examples

### Example 1
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/endpoint" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"key": "value"}'
```

### Example 2
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/v1/endpoint/parameter"
```

## Response Format

Example response:
```json
{
  "key": "value",
  "nested": {
    "key": "value"
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   KEY1=value1
   KEY2=value2
   ```

2. The application will automatically load these variables when started.

Note: Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive information.

## Docker Deployment

The application can be deployed using Docker for a secure, isolated environment.

### Building the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t app-name .
```

### Running the Container

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 app-name
```

### Docker Security Features

- Uses minimal base image
- Runs as non-root user
- Implements security best practices
- Regular system package updates
- Proper file permissions and ownership

### Production Considerations

- Use Docker secrets for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting
- Use HTTPS
- Regular image updates
- Docker Content Trust for image signing

## Development Setup

For development, install the additional development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Testing

The project uses pytest for testing and pytest-cov for coverage reporting.

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
python -m pytest test_app.py
```

### Test Coverage

View test coverage report:
```bash
python -m pytest --cov=app test_app.py
```

Generate HTML coverage report:
```bash
python -m pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html test_app.py
```

## Error Handling

The application provides detailed error messages for:
- Invalid input
- API request failures
- Authentication issues
- Rate limiting

## Dependencies

- `fastapi`: Web framework for building APIs
- `uvicorn`: ASGI server for running the application
- `requests`: HTTP client for making API requests
- `pydantic`: Data validation and settings management
